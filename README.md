# Making your own inclusive bot

## What, why, how
Ever saw a word in a repository that really made you feel bad? Why use it? Can't we use something else? We can!
How? At the point we use them, when we are making changes, wouldn't it be great to have a reminder of what anyone in our team found to be unhelfpul and unfriendly?

## Gathering the words
We need to talk to one another, ask the difficult questions of what feels unfriendly, unhelpful and not inclusive. If we can gather up those words in a place that is easily updatable, we are always thinking about how best to make everyone feel welcome. 


## Step 1
To begin, you'll need to be logged into your GitHub account, and you'll need to create a new repository. Make it public for the moment.

You can call it `inclusiveBot_yourname`

## Step 2
Create yaml files

## Step 3
Explain each bit of yaml files

## Step 4

## Step 5

## Step 6

## Step 7
index.js and writing the the functions that will look at the incoming pull requests

## Step 8
The messaging, who it comes from and what it says

## Step 9
Set up test file and test

## Step 10
Set up on your own repo and test
